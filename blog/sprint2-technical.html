<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Borders, margins, width, height, alignment, properties etc CSS can be very overwhemling so let’s start out by appointing an HMTL item to center our discussion around. Below is a very simple HTML item and within that item is the text "Demo Content".</p>
<div id="democontainer"><div id="demobox">Demo Content</div></div>
<p>Here's how the padding, border and margin have been applied to 'the box':</p>
<h4>Padding</h4>
<img src="../imgs/tb1paint.jpg" alt="plate with food" style="float:right; width:270px;height:auto; margin-left: 15px;">
<p>The content of the box is the text “Demo Content”. Padding allows you to set the space <i>around</i> the content.the padding has been illustrated above by the white area between the content and the border.</p>
<h4>Border</h4>
<p>The border of the HTML item is represented by the brown outline. The border acts as a perimeter around the content and its padding.</p>
<h4>Margin</h4>
<p>The orange around the border is called the margin. The margins job is to provide space between the HTML object whichs and the surrounding HTML objects. In the example above the margin is ensuring the text above and below are not impeding on the brown border, white padding or the text content "Demo Content".</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Margin, Border, and Padding is all about space relative to each other, it all starts with content then to present that content we add padding to keep the border from making it difficult to read or interpret the content. Next in line we have the border to either highight or protect the content and finally we have the margin to make sure other object and content does not impeed.</p>
<p>The art work in the image on the right does not use CSS but it does help us understand CSS becasue the content is clearly a boat and there is little to no padding before a very strong border followed by a margin between the border and the desk below.</p>
