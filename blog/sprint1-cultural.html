           <div class="card" id="card2">
           <p style="text-align: left;">A story that I feel reflects my personality, identity and values is not a glamorous one but simply a story of planning and perseverance.<br><br>
            The story begins in Wellington in my partner Lara and my rented apartment on Courtney Place around late December 2016. Probably while chatting on a Friday night, eating a slice of Tommy Millions pizza we decided we wanted to own our own home. We didn’t have much money saved at the time and due to the recent terrifying earthquake we had an option to get out of the contract on our apartment in early January 2017. To Lara’s shock, I suggested we move in with her grandparents in Paraparaumu to save money for a deposit.<br><br>
            In late January 2017, while living at Lara’s grandparents house we came to the conclusion that the company she was currently employed by was not going to last and was in its final death throws financially. Part of my plan to get our own home required us to move to Christchurch. Not only was Christchurch one of the last major city in NZ with affordable housing, it was also where our families were based. Moving to a new city would make getting a new job as an employee difficult for my partner; being an accountant I suggest she become a contractor and operate out of her own limited company.<br><br>
            Though my partners perseverance and my encouragement the move to open her own company was very successful. We caught a break when an option to sublease a friend’s apartment in Hataitai at a reasonable rate while they were overseas for 3 months came up. We took it mostly because we didn’t want to overstay our welcome with my her grandparents.<br><br> 
            Hataitai was great but the biggest phase of the plan was still in front of us. I had to end my current employment and with only a hatchback we had to move islands and head  to Christchurch where we would live Lara’s parents until we could finish saving the deposit. I quit my job with nothing lined up only the hope to open my own company like Lara had done just a few months earlier and work remotely with her from her parents spare bedroom in Christchurch.<br><br>
            My company was not as successful but I did manage to get a contract and work remotely. So there we were, 7 months from that initial discussion both working remotely from my partners parents spare bedroom.<br><br> 
            It certainly was a testing period of time. We lived extremely frugally and missed the privacy of living alone. 4 long months later we purchased our first home and moved in on the 22nd of Dec 2017, about 12 months after we set that objective.<br><br>
            This is not a story of great success but a story that reflects my goal driven nature, perseverance and team work.<br><br>
            Last month after working from the home I purchased above I quite my job and started Dev acdemy to start yet another long term plan with object of independence and freedom for me and my now fiancé, Lara.

           <div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Personality Test</h2></div>
           <div class="card" id="card2">
           <p style="text-align: left;">During my research I came across the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 personalities test</a> which is based on the Myers-Briggs personality types. The test did not take to long and the results were very interesting, I would suggest to anyone reading this to take the test as you like me might learn something about yourself.<br><br>
            The test resulted in me being diagnosed with the personality type “Architect” which I then explored by reading about further. I am not really someone who believes in personality types as I think of each person as an individual but I must say it was pretty bang on, “Architects have a natural thirst for knowledge”, “Architects will keep up with just a few good friends, eschewing larger circles of acquaintances in favor of depth and quality.” Examples like these kept resonating with me.<br><br>
            Strengths of an Architect personality type;<br></p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Quick, Imaginative, and Strategic Mind</li>
                <li>High Self</li>
                <li>Independent and Decisive</li>
                <li>Hard-Working and Determined</li>
                <li>Open-Minded</li>
                <li>Open-Minded</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Weaknesses of an Architect personality type;<br></p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Arrogant</li>
                <li>Judemental</li>
                <li>Overly Analytical</li>
                <li>Loathe Highly Structured Environments</li>
                <li>Clueless in Romance</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left;">I’m glad I took the test and then took the time to read about the “Architect” personality type I was diagnosed but I’m hesitant to use this information as I don’t really want to put myself into a box and have it impact my decision making.</p>

           <div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Strengths, Values and Limitations</h2></div>
           <div class="card" id="card2">
           <p style="text-align: left;">I was born in the 90s and grew up in a very small South Island town “Geraldine”, I believe this shaped me into a person who is humble and a person who appreciates simplicity, knowledge, and learning. I was around when the internet was terrible but by the time I was a teenager the internet was as great as it is today, it was the best teacher a young adult could have in my situation. I established a solid group of friends from that small town and we still see each other at least once or twice a year.<br><br>
           Happiness -
           Through talking to friends, family, and just reflecting on myself “Happiness” was the first of my self-diagnosed values. I am generally happy and value happiness as I am grateful to be alive and live in such a peaceful country with so many opportunities. I love stand-up comedy and laugh at everything even bad jokes, I just love a person for trying to get them in. Happiness makes me generally pretty good to work and learn with, but it does have drawback as I do not handle sad social situations very well.<br><br>
           Calm - 
           In my former role as a small business advisor in a very fast-moving environment my team-members described me as a “Air Hostess” because my calm approach to big workloads and unruly customers made them feel at ease. I am patient and listen well which I think comes across as calm, but this comment took me a little by surprise as had not really considered my exterior as calm because my brain always seems busy.<br><br>
           Open-Minded -
           I really value hearing out new ideas as well as coming up with new ideas. Being open minded has really helped me in my career and learning as it has allowed me to view things differently and come up with some great ideas a few of which I have been able to implement company wide. 
           Ethical - 
           I have trained and practised as an accountant for the past 6 years, during the last 3 years me and my partner worked from home where we had a dedicated office. One day my partner suggested we claim our new coffee machine as a business expense and of course I said no because obviously, after a heated debate I stuck to my guns as I was not going to claim it just because I was fortunate enough to know how to. To this day my partners still thinks she is right.<br><br>
           Limitations - 
           All values and strengths have a downside but I think the thing that limits me the most is when I don’t understand why I am doing something, if there is no clear reason for doing something I will be very hesitant to do it. An example of this is a Xmas tree, why put a fake tree in your house for a month when its just you and another adult who live there.
