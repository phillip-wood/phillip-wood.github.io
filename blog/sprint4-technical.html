            <p>I found myself blocked when creating a function to remove the word “buzz” in all its forms from any given sentence. 
                I started off by calling the replace method which allows you to input both a string/word you would like to replace and a string/word you want to replace it with. 
                As you can see below it worked but instead of replacing the word buzz with <i>nothing</i>, it created an empty space instead.</p>
            <img src="../imgs/tb4space.JPG" style="width: 100%";>
            <p>To solve the problem, I began by logging the outputs to the console and then Google searching to try and understand why I was getting the spaces instead of <i>nothing</i>.
                After 5 minutes of searching yielding no useful information my frustration began to build. I decided to return to my code and review the replace requirements i had written; /buzz/gi”. 
                The word I wanted to replace was “buzz”. The “g” extension told the replace method to look for all occurrences of “buzz”, the “i” extension told it “buzz” 
                was case incentive e.g. “Buzz”, “buZZ”.</p>
            <img src="../imgs/tb4space1.JPG" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>During this review process I chnaged the replace method to: “/buzz  /gi“. this told it to replace the word buzz and the space following it with a single space. Thankfully that worked, however it  
                passed test 2 but failed test 3 because the sentence ended with “buzz” with no space after it so my replace method would not work</p>
            <img src="../imgs/tb4space2.JPG" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>I returned to console logging and troubleshooting and decided to make the problem easier and just come up with a solution to replace the word “buzz” but with a space in front of it (i.e. " buzz).
                To solve the problem I simply actioned the same solution I had used last time, however this time I put the space before buzz and it worked.<br><br>My final solution passed all of the tests and in the process learned to break down a problem into smaller problems and focus on solving one small problem at a time.</p>

            <p>The problem I was given was to write a function that would join an array or collection of words together into one big word, so if given the words “to” and “day” the function would return “today”.<br><br> 
                I started the problem by studying what was required to pass test’s 1,2 & 3 and then writing down pseudocode which is basically just writing down what you want to happen in a text format that is not read by the computer but only by other people using your code. 
                I wrote “join an array into one string” and then I googled that and the first thing to come up was the join method.</p>
            <img src="../imgs/tb4space3.JPG" style="width: 100%;">
            <p>I did a bit of reading then copied the second example shown above into my function and it worked. The join method I wrote passed all three tests and felt proud of my googling abilities. When I reflected on this later I learned that writing down what you want in plain English is a great way to start and also a great way to google.</p>

            <p>Pseudocode – This is a great way to start a problem however I’m not yet confident in my ability to write it in a way that others can understand.<br><br>
                Trying something – I am very confident trying all kinds of solutions and saving each iteration in case I need it later.<br><br>
                Rubber ducky method – Not confident using this method as I share an office with others and it seems strange.<br><br>
                Reading error messages – No idea what the messages mean most of the time I just look for the line refences.<br><br>
                Console.logging – This paired with “Trying something” is a great way to stumble into a solution.<br><br>
                Googling – This is actually hard to do in the tech realm as there are so many solutions but I’m getting more confident with experience.  I found writing pseudocode helped with this. <br><br> 
                Asking your peers for help – Talking with peers is a great way to feel less alone regarding problems but also to get some good tips as they are working on the same tasks.<br><br>
                Asking coaches for help – Have not asked for help from coaches as of yet.<br><br>  
                Improving your process with reflection – Reflecting is one of the key things to getting better because you get more out of each problem not only solving the problem itself but then you get to look back on how you did it.
