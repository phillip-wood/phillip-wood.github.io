<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Recently we built a front fence for our house. We built the fence for safety and privacy from the busy street. The fence itself is like HTML but the way the fence has been presented or styled is like CSS. When planning to build the fence I had to decide on the structure, perimeter, and approach I wanted to apply to my raw materials, this process is much like ‘HTML’, all of the objects and materials arranged in a structure that will meet the objectives of the project.<br><br>
    Once I had finished building the fence, my fiancé, Lara, painted it and applied decorative caps on the posts. The styling she applied to the fence I had built was the ‘CSS’ of the fence building project.</p>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Control Flow and Loops</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Control flow is the order in which code is executed. Control flow is like my grandad with his magnifying glass reading the paper, he reads each word one after the other from left to right to interpret and understand that particular story in the newsapaer.
When it was my turn to use the magnifying glass I would like my grandad begin reading left to right but but as I was not the best reader I would have to jump back maybe several times to the start of the sentence until I understood the message being communicated by the collection of words in the story.<img src="../imgs/tb3mag.png" alt="" Style="float:right; width: auto; height: 150px;"><br><br>


Developers just like younger me with the magnifying glass can manipulate the control flow, an example of a manipulated control flow is called a loop. A loop is a type of control flow that is read and exercuted over and over agin until the criteria is met. 
An example of a loop would be me trying to find a carpark close to where I want to go, while there are no free parking spots in sight I would loop around he carpark until I would find one but if the loop count was greater than three loops I would decide that its not worth it and leave. </p>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">The Document Oject Model "DOM"</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>The Document Object Model "DOM" is a HTML reading structure. HTML is read by web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox, they all follow the same rules dictated by a governing body. Documents have a logical structure and HTML elements have relationships with one another to be structured together when interpreted by the DOM. Below is an example.</p>
<img src="../imgs/texample.JPG" alt="" Style="float:right; width:auto; height: 300px;">
<table style="border-style: dotted; width:60%;">
    <row>
        <th>header1</th>
        <th>header2</th>
        ,
        <tr>
            <td>1</Td>
            <Td>2</Td>
        </tr>
        <th>header3</th>
        <tr>
            <td>3</Td>
            <Td>4</Td>
        </tr>
    </row>
</table>

<p>This code example shows the HTML structure of a table element shown above, the DOM interprets the code and understands the relationship of each element of the “Table”. You can see that the Table has two rows three headings, and 4 values, the web browser is not going to print these items as a list like in the HTML code you can see on the left, it is going to implement a structure as you can see in the table on the above. 
    JavaScript allows you to manipulate HTML but its important to understand how the DOM works before doing this as if the JavaScript is interpreted by the DOM before the HTML element being manipulated then technically it does not yet exist to be manipulated, developers use the code "DOMContentLoaded" to get around this error which tells the Dom to read all the HTML before running this function.

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Arrays and Objects.</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
   
<p><img src="../imgs/tb3shop.JPG" alt="" Style="float:right; width:auto; height: 80px;">A JavaScript array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, it has no order it is just a list of elements that you can access via an index. An array is indexed starting from 0 and can be accessed by calling the array along with the index of the element you wish to return. An example of an array would be a grocery list.<br><br><img src="../imgs/tb3Obj.JPG" alt="" Style="float:left; width:auto; height: 200px;">
    A JavaScript object is very much the same as an array however it is slightly more structured as it has properties, an example of a JS object could be an airline flight, the flight has a flight number, duration, destination etc. You can access JS objects and any of their properties by simply calling the object and the name of the property you would like to access.<br><br><br><br><br>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;"> Functions</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p> A function in JavaScript is a procedure set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, 
    it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.<br><br>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript becasuse they speed up workflow by allowing you to simply call a function by name with an input and it will follow the preprogramed procedure on that input and produce an output. Writing JS code would be very difficult if we could not write our own functions you call on time and time agin to process large data but even worse if we could not call on built-in functions we did not even have to write such as ".lenght" and "console.log".    </p>
