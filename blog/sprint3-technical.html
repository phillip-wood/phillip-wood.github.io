<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Recently we built a front fence for our house. We built the fence for safety and privacy from the busy street. The fence itself is like HTML but the way the fence has been presented or styled is like CSS. When planning to build the fence I had to decide on the structure, perimeter, and approach I wanted to apply to my raw materials, this process is much like ‘HTML’, all of the objects and materials arranged in a structure that will meet the objectives of the project.<br><br>
    Once I had finished building the fence, my fiancé, Lara, painted it and applied decorative caps on the posts. The styling she applied to the fence I had built was the ‘CSS’ of the fence building project.</p>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Control Flow and Loops</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Control flow is the order in which code is executed. Control flow is like my grandad with his magnifying glass reading the paper, he reads each word one after the other from left to right to interpret and understand that particular story in the newsapaer.
<img src="../imgs/tb3mag.png" alt="" Style="float:right; width: auto; height: 150px;">When it was my turn to use the magnifying glass I would like my grandad begin reading left to right but but as I was not the best reader I would have to jump back to the start of the sentence several times until I understood the message being communicated by the collection of words in the story.<br><br>


Developers just like younger me with the magnifying glass can manipulate the control flow, an example of a manipulated control flow is called a loop. A loop is a type of control flow that is read and exercuted over and over agin until the criteria is met. 
An example of a loop would be me trying to find a carpark close to where I want to go, while there are no free parking spots in sight I loop around the carpark until I can find a parking spot, I could be lopping forever so I set a count of 3 loops and if I still have not sucessfully parked after 3 loops of the parking lot I stop trying to park and decide to do something else with my time or move to another parking location. </p>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">The Document Oject Model "DOM"</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>The Document Object Model "DOM" is a HTML reading structure. HTML is read by web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox, they all follow the same rules dictated by a governing body. Documents have a logical structure and HTML elements have relationships with one another to be structured together when interpreted by the DOM. Below is an example.</p>
<img src="../imgs/texample.JPG" alt="" Style="float:right; width:auto; height: 300px;">
<table style="border-style: dotted; width:60%;">
    <row>
        <th>header1</th>
        <th>header2</th>
        ,
        <tr>
            <td>1</Td>
            <Td>2</Td>
        </tr>
        <th>header3</th>
        <tr>
            <td>3</Td>
            <Td>4</Td>
        </tr>
    </row>
</table>

<p>This code example shows the HTML structure of a table element, shown above. The DOM interprets the code and understands the relationship of each element and how they should be presented within the 'Table'. As you can see, the Table has two rows, three headings, and 4 values. In the HTML code on the right you can see theses items listed. DOM means that the web browser knows not to simply show these items as they appear in the code, but instead in a table format, as you can see above.
    
    <br><br>JavaScript allows you to manipulate HTML but its important to understand how the DOM works before doing this. The DOM reads code from top to bottom; that means that if the JavaScript is read by the DOM <i>before</i> the HTML element you intended to apply your Javascript code to it will not work as the associated HTML element will not technically exist yet. Developers use the eventlistener "DOMContentLoaded" to get around this error which tells the DOM to read all the HTML before running a particular Javascript function.

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Arrays and Objects</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
   
<p><img src="../imgs/tb3shop.JPG" alt="" Style="float:right; width:auto; height: 80px;">A JavaScript array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements. It has no particular order it is simply a list of elements that you can access via an index. An array is indexed starting from 0 and can be accessed by calling the array along with the index of the element you wish to return. An example of an array would be a grocery list.<br><br><img src="../imgs/tb3Obj.JPG" alt="" Style="float:left; width:auto; height: 200px;">
    A JavaScript object is very similar to an array, however it is slightly more structured as it has properties. An example of a JavaScript object could be an airline flight and it's associated information; the flight has a flight number, duration, destination etc. You can access JavaScript objects and any of their properties by simply calling the object and the name of the property you would like to access.<br><br>The example on the left is a javascript object called myDog and it has all the common properies of a dog, a name, a leg count, a tail count, and of course an array of enemies.<br><br><br>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;"> Functions</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p> In JavaScript, a 'function' is a procedure set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. For a procedure to qualify as a function, 
    it should most likely receive an input and return an output.<br><br>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript becasuse they speed up workflow by allowing you to simply call a function by name with an input and have your programme follow the preprogramed procedure on that input and produce an output. Writing JS code would be very difficult if we could not write our own functions. Without functions you would have to make calls time and time again in order to process large volumes of data. To make matters worse, without access to JavaScripts pre-written functions, we could not call on built-in functions such as ".length" and "console.log".    </p>
