<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>EQ, or Emotional intelligence is a measure of the ability to interpret the communications of yourself and other people on a deeper level. Communications can come in many forms including artwork, body language, spoken language, basically, all forms of message relaying.<br><br>
Emotions are a state of mind such as happy, sad, angry etc, when we talk about emotions on a deeper level we are referring to why a person is communicating a particular emotion. An example of deeper level emotion is “hangry” which is a brilliant word that means a person is communicating anger because they are irritable due to hunger. Basic emotional intelligence is often referred to as maturity as the more exposure you have to human emotions and culture the better you get at understanding the reasoning behind why people may be communicating that particular emotion at that particular time. Going beyond your unsual daily social interactions and exposing yourself to different cultures is also a known way to increase your emtoional intelligence as your knowledge of different cultures increases.<br><br>
Emotional Intelligence is also a person understating their own emotions and how they can use them to help themselves and communicate with other people. Self reflection is a way of reliving your experience's to understand who you are and how you have responed in the past and use that information in future.

<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>IQ, or intelligence quotient is a measure of a person’s knowledge and problem-solving abilities. IQ has been quantified as a number because of the popular IQ tests invented in the 1900’s. EQ and IQ are both a measure of a person’s ability to interpret and respond to communications. IQ measures a person’s analytical processing speed and it does this by asking a person to interpret a problem and response to it correctly as fast as possible. EQ is a measure of a person’s ability to interpret another person’s emotional state of mind as well as their own emotional state of mind and respond as they see fit.

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Why is it important?</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Developing emotional intelligence is an important part of life as it helps you communicate with other people in a deeper more meaningful way which helps build deeper connections.<br><br>
    Forming deeper connections with others allows you to work better as a team and in a team environment. There is always going to be conflict when humans work together as we all interpret communications differently but having a higher emotional intelligence will allow people to look past surface emotional responses during times of conflict and return to working as a team.<br><br>
    Not only is emotional intelligence important for team projects but its also important for your own wellbeing as the more you understand yourself and your emotions the more likely you are to achieve your own goals such as happiness.
