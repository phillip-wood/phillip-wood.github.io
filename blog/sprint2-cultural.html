    <div class="card" id="card2"><p style="text-align: left;">My goal is to gain an entry level position in the tech industry as a web developer. Long term I would Like to have the confidence and know how to create, manage, and launch a web-based software. Outside of the technical skills I would like to develop my understanding of workflow methodologies and improve my written communication including typing skills.<br><br>
        My strengths are planning and teamwork. My weaknesses are written communication, especially wordy descriptive text. I also struggle for motivation if I feel there is no clear purpose to a task. More detail about my strengths and weaknesses are in my blog “Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration”.<br><br>
        I commit to managing my workload by setting goals each day and keeping to the suggested timeboxes, if I go over the timeboxes I will make that time up where I can.<br><br>
        I commit to communicating as needed with fellow learners and facilitators to get the most out of this experience.<br><br>
        I expect the facilitation team to provide me with constructive feedback and speed up my learning by directing me to useful learning content I need develop my skills and meet my objectives.<br><br>
