<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to grow and reorganize neural networks, this simply means a person’s brain can change shape and organize itself to improve your thinking speed the more it is used. Also just imagining a problem or situation will cause your brain to adapt.<br><br>
Understanding your brain can get better the more you practice or even just imagine yourself practicing is a huge confidence boost to a person’s willingness to learn new things.<br><br> 
Now that I am aware of neuroplasticity, I feel more confident that with time I will continue to get better at tasks I have in the past struggled with and avoided. To increase your neuroplasticity, you must brain train which is a way of continually testing your brain in an area you would like to improve. A common way to brain train is to repeat a process or task repeatedly for example I often challenge myself with a SUDOKU puzzle to improve the time it takes for me to solve them. You can also brain train by just imagining how you would solve a SUDOKU puzzle repeatedly in your mind, so your brain grows that neural network.<br><br>   
I find games and puzzles a fun way to brain train, here is a <a href="https://www.lumosity.com" target="_blank">link</a> to Lumosity a program of brain games designed to improve your brain but also to have a little fun.

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Growth Mindset</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>A growth mindset is a person’s belief in their brains ability to improve in all subjects. as a former accountant I can tell you that is very common for adults to have a fixed mindset especially when it comes to mathematics, all most everyday I would get the disclaimer from a client that they were not good at math’s and in a way without really knowing it I would preach to them that actually most people get better the more they do it and unlike school your want to do this as its exciting as these numbers reflect your businesses performance which is a measure of your own success.<br><br>
    I always believed I could learn anything but I honestly had a fixed mindset when it came writing and a few other areas of communication but after this exploration that has changed and I now believe I can get better at some of the areas I previously just accepted I would never be good at.<br><br>
    Simply understanding neuroplasticity and a growth mindset has made me feel more confident about my learning journey at Dev as I was told that changing careers was very hard because old habits and routines could hinder your ability to fit into a new industry, obviously I now know this is not true and nothing can stop my brain from developing.<br><br>
    I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>  by John Spencer helpful.
