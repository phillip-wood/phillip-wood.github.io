<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to grow and reorganise neural networks, this simply means a persons' brain can change shape and organise itself to improve brain power the more it is used on a particular topic. Also just imagining a problem or situation will cause your brain to adapt at almost the same rate as actually solving a problem.<br><br>
Understanding your brain can get better the more you practice or even just imagine yourself practicing is a huge confidence boost to a person’s willingness to learn new things.<br><br> 
Now that I am aware of neuroplasticity, I feel more confident that with time I will continue to get better at tasks I have in the past struggled with and avoided. To increase your neuroplasticity you must brain train which is a way of continually testing your brain in an area you would like to improve. A common way to brain train is to repeat a process or task repeatedly for example I often challenge myself with a SUDOKU puzzle to improve the time it takes for me to solve them. You can also brain train by just imagining how you would solve a SUDOKU puzzle repeatedly in your mind, so your brain grows that neural network.<br><br>   
I find games and puzzles a fun way to brain train, here is a <a href="https://www.lumosity.com" target="_blank">link</a> to Lumosity a program of brain games designed to improve your brain but also to have a little fun.

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Growth Mindset</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
<p>A growth mindset is a person’s belief in their brains ability to improve in all subjects. As a former accountant I can tell you that is very common for adults to have a fixed mindset especially when it comes to mathematics, all most everyday I would get the disclaimer from a client that they were not good at math’s and thats just the way they were born. Not knowing about growth mindset at the time I would often just make these "bad at math" clients feel better by verbalising what the numbers in the reports represented.<br><br>
    I always believed I could learn anything but I honestly had a fixed mindset when it came writing and a few other areas of communication but after this exploration that has changed and I now believe I can get better at some of the areas I previously just accepted I would never be good at.<br><br>
    Simply understanding neuroplasticity and a growth mindset has made me feel more confident about my learning journey at Dev as I was told that changing careers was very hard because old habits and routines could hinder your ability to fit into a new industry. I now know this is not true and nothing can stop my brain from developing.<br><br>
    I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>  by John Spencer on the topic of "Growth Mindset" helpful.
