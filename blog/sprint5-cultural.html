<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>I learned that I am someone who likes to be prepared and know as much as possible, the driver behind this is the fear that I could lose face in front of others if I say something incorrect or stupid in my mind. I feel though the foundations core content I have learned to be less fearful of not knowing everything and instead be more confident to deal which a situation as and when they occur by trusting in my abilities.
        Entering foundations, I thought I had poor written communication skills as I had always struggled with it in the past. By the end of foundations my written communication skills improved but more importantly my mindset had changed from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.

    <h4>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
    <p>Programing requires perseverance and collaboration with others. Understanding your values helps you keep motivated and work on a problem in an efficient manner in terms of your mental state of mind, you donâ€™t want to just keep banging your head on a problem you need to know where your head is at and take a break or a different approach. 
        Empathy and self-awareness is a key aspect of a successful team, you need to know your current state of mind and also understanding how others are feeling in order to communicate and collaborate in a manner most suited for all members in the team.

    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
    <p>I was surprised by how difficult I found some of it compared to the techy stuff which made logical sense. Core content was not black and white and left me feeling indecisive especially when talking about myself and my values.</p>
    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>In the earlier sprints it was hard for me to reflect on my values and who I was as a person, I had not done that before. Understanding yourself is not an easy feat and its hard at times to acknowledge your own strengths and weaknesses. </p>
    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
    <p>The driving forces behind the core content is the tech industry itself, the industry has developed into a more team focused approach rather than relying on one outstanding individual. I think dev also realises the overwhelming nature of learning to program, it requires a learner to be pushed continually week after week to build the confidence and knowledge required to stay in the learning zone without being stressed out.</p>
    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
    <p>At times it felt like I was wasting my time, however by the end of the process once time had pasted I started to understand that the core learnings were improving my programming as when I was encountering issues I was finding myself reflecting on myself and the situation rather than just bashing out code meaninglessly until the problem was solved.</p>

<div class="card" id="card1"><h2 link="" style="display: inline;">Bootcamp Expectations</h2></div>
<div class="card" style="text-align:left; background-color: #faf6e6;">
    <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>I hope to get employment in the tech industry after completion of this course, once employed I hope to hone my skillset both tech and non-tech further until I can contribute in some way to everyday lives of New Zealanders.</p>
    <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</h4>
    <p>My biggest strength going into bootcamp will be my determination and ability to keep an open mind.<br>My biggest weakness will be communicating verbally to a group of my peers and communicating tech issues with others</p>
    <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
    <p>Speaking in front of a group of people about programming or about myself will be very challenging.</p>
    <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
    <p>I would like to see my confidence and skills as a leader develop during Bootcamp. </p>
    <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
    <p>I want to get the most out of this experience and I have made a commitment to myself to reflect each day to make sure I am on track and to seek as much feedback from facilitators and peers as possible. </p>
